## hoteldusk-tools
This is a toolkit I'm using to work with the file formats from Hotel Dusk: Room 215. This repo includes binaries for converting image, animation, and others.

### Usage
To use this tool, simply drag and drop the related file(s) onto the executable.

### Note
why the output image or animation appear sideways? well this is expected because the game itself is played sideways as well. The assets are preserved in their original orientation.
